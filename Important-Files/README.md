# Project-Utility

<h2>The Motto: Code more, work less.</h2>

The majority of this project will be written in Java. More specificly it will be written using just plain java. JavaFX and other libraries (Such as kryonet for networking) are allowed, but I don't perticularly like them, and I can do just about anything in plain Java. For some of the more advanced projects I may create a program in C/C++/C++11/C++14 in order to do some things that java isn't great at. I will still post the source code for those projects (But as a result they will be heavily commented. Java and C are nearly identical and with comments it should be pretty simple.). The details of the project will be released shortly, but it isn't a small scale project. The requirements are listed below. If you don't meet some, meet them before the set date below (date is subject to change).

<h3>Starting Date: February 1st</h3>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
1. FileIO (MUST HAVE FOR MANY THINGS)
2. ArrayLists (MUST HAVE FOR DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION)
3. HashMaps (MUST HAVE FOR DYANMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION)
4. Generic Types (MUST HAVE MOSTLY TO SAVE TIME AND REDUCE REDUNDANT CODE)
5. Polymorphism (MUST HAVE MOSTLY TO SAVE TIME)
6. Abstarct Classes (MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO REDUCE REDUNDANT CODE)
<hr>

<h3>Optional:</h3>
1. Networking (GOOD TO KNOW, BUT IS KINDA TRICKY)

2. JavaFX (GOOD TO KNOW FOR BUILDING A GOOD LOOKING GUI)

3. SQL (GOOD TO KNOW FOR MANAGING DATABASES BUT I MAY IMPLEMENT SOMETHING IN C/JAVA THAT DOES THE SAME THING. ILL TRY TO DO IT SO THAT NOT EVERYBODY HAS TO LEARN SQL AS IT SUCKS IN MY OPINION) <--- Seperate programming language pronounced as "sequel"

4. C/C++/C++11/C++14 (GOOD TO KNOW AS I USE IT OFTEN) <--- Seperate programming language(s)

<h3><font color='red'>Rules:</font></h3>
1. Always comment code. It helps others read it, and reduces the time it takes to go back and change things for later releases. You may not be the only one working on a portion of the project, so it will be in the best interest of all of use to have this luxury.

2. Always write good quality code. Crap code that is barely functional can be submitted, but only in the case that you get stuck and need help. In this case, post an issue on the project, as it may not be seen otherwise.
